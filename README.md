# APB Localization Editor

Localization Editor for the game All Points Bulletin (Reloaded). 

### Requirements
  - .NET Framework 4.6+
  - Game installed

### How it works
  - Set installation folder (for example: C:\Program files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\APB Reloaded)
  - You'll be asked to create "GER" localization files (copy from "INT" files)
  - Select a file -> section -> key
  - Edit text
  - Press "Save" to keep changes

### Notice
This program edits game files inside the installation folder. There was no confirmation if editing those files is allowed and the ToS disallows this. Please use this piece of software at your own risk. You CAN get banned!
